# movie-database-web-interface

We developed a user interface to query movie databases. As in specification, the user can add actor/director/movie/review as well as movie/director movie/actor relations to database. Also, search button is on right top corner and can be used at any page of the website. 

The five webpages were written by Yu Zhang. Qi Sang was in charge of implementation of search and user interface design.
